<div class="row">
  <div class="column side" style="background-color:#aaa;"><br>The common cold is a viral infection of your nose and throat (upper respiratory tract).</br>
    <br>It's usually harmless, although it might not feel that way
    Many types of viruses can cause a common cold.</br>
<br>Children younger than six are at greatest risk of colds, but healthy adults can also expect to have two or three colds annually.</br>
    <br>Most people recover from a common cold in a week or 10 days.</br>
<br>Symptoms might last longer in people who smoke.</br>
<br>If symptoms don't improve, see your doctor.</br>
     <br> Symptoms of a common cold usually appear one to three days after exposure to a cold-causing virus.</br>
   
   
    </div>
 
    
    <div class="column middle" style="background-color:#bbb;"><br>Signs and symptoms, which can vary from person to person, might include:</br>
<li>Runny or stuffy nose.</li>
<li>Sore throat.</li>
<li>Cough.</li>
<li>Congestion.</li>
<li>Slight body aches or a mild headache.</li>
<li>Sneezing.</li>
<li>Low-grade fever.</li>
<li>Generally feeling unwell (malaise)</li>
 
    </div>

    
<div class="column side" style="background-color:#ccc;"><br>Cold remedies that work.</li>
       <li> Stay hydrated: drink Water,juice, clear broth or warm lemon water with honey helps loosen congestion and prevents dehydration.</li>
 <li>Avoid alcohol, coffee and caffeinated sodas, which can make dehydration worse.</li>
 <li>  Rest: Your body needs to heal.</li>
        
        <li> Soothe a sore throat: A saltwater gargle — 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt dissolved in an 8-ounce glass of warm water — can temporarily relieve a sore or scratchy throat.</li>
        <li> Children younger than 6 years are unlikely to be able to gargle properly.</li>
 <li>You can also try ice chips, sore throat sprays, lozenges or hard candy.</li>
        <li> Don't give lozenges or hard candy to children younger than 3 to 4 years old because they can choke on them.</li>
        <li> Sip warm liquids: taking in warm liquids, such as chicken soup, tea, or warm apple juice, might be soothing and might ease congestion by increasing mucus flow.</li></div>
